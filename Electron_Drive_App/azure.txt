Box 1:
Azure virtual machines provide operation system virtualization.
Azure Virtual Machines (VM) is one of several types of on-demand, scalable computing resources that Azure offers. Typically, you choose a VM when you need more control over the computing environment than the other choices offer.
Box 2:
Azure Container Instances provide portable environments for virtualized applications.
Containers are becoming the preferred way to package, deploy, and manage cloud applications. Azure Container Instances offers the fastest and simplest way to run a container in Azure, without having to manage any virtual machines and without having to adopt a higher-level service.
Containers offer significant startup benefits over virtual machines (VMs). Azure Container Instances can start containers in Azure in seconds, without the need to provision and manage VMs.
Box 3:
Azure App Service is used to build, deploy and scale web apps.
Azure App Service is a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering that lets you create web and mobile apps for any platform or device and connect to data anywhere, in the cloud or on-premises. App Service includes the web and mobile capabilities that were previously delivered separately as Azure Websites and Azure Mobile
Services.
Box 4:
Azure Functions provide a platform for serverless code.
Azure Functions is a serverless compute service that lets you run event-triggered code without having to explicitly provision or manage infrastructure.

You have an Azure subscription named Subscription1. You sign in to the Azure portal and create a resource group named RG1.
From Azure documentation, you have the following command that creates a virtual machine named VM1. az vm create --resource-group RG1 --name VM1 --image UbuntuLTS --generate-ssh-keys
You need to create VM1 in Subscription1 by using the command.
Solution: From the Azure portal, launch Azure Cloud Shell and select Bash. Run the command in Cloud Shell.
Does this meet the goal?

Your Azure environment contains multiple Azure virtual machines.
You need to ensure that a virtual machine named VM1 is accessible from the Internet over HTTP.
Solution: You modify an Azure Traffic Manager profile.
A) Azure Traffic Manager is a DNS-based load balancing solution. It is not used to ensure that a virtual machine named VM1 is accessible from the Internet over
HTTP.
To ensure that a virtual machine named VM1 is accessible from the Internet over HTTP, you need to modify a network security group or Azure Firewall.
In this question, we need to add a rule to a network security group or Azure Firewall to allow the connection to the virtual machine on port 80 (HTTP).

Which service provides network traffic filtering across multiple Azure subscriptions and virtual networks?
A. Azure Firewall
B. an application security group
C. Azure DDoS protection
D. a network security group (NSG)
 
Correct Answer: A üó≥Ô∏è
You can restrict traffic to multiple virtual networks in multiple subscriptions with a single Azure firewall.
Azure Firewall is a managed, cloud-based network security service that protects your Azure Virtual Network resources. It's a fully stateful firewall as a service with built-in high availability and unrestricted cloud scalability.
You can centrally create, enforce, and log application and network connectivity policies across subscriptions and virtual networks. Azure Firewall uses a static public IP address for your virtual network resources allowing outside firewalls to identify traffic originating from your virtual network.

Which Azure service should you use to store certificates?
A. Azure Security Center
B. an Azure Storage account
C. Azure Key Vault Most Voted
D. Azure Information Protection
 
Correct Answer: C üó≥Ô∏è
Azure Key Vault is a secure store for storage various types of sensitive information including passwords and certificates.
Azure Key Vault can be used to Securely store and tightly control access to tokens, passwords, certificates, API keys, and other secrets.
Secrets and keys are safeguarded by Azure, using industry-standard algorithms, key lengths, and hardware security modules (HSMs). The HSMs used are
Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 140-2 Level 2 validated.
Access to a key vault requires proper authentication and authorization before a caller (user or application) can get access. Authentication establishes the identity of the caller, while authorization determines the operations that they are allowed to perform.
