## Introduction

Eduverse is an innovative desktop application designed to streamline skill acquisition by providing users with personalized, AI-powered learning roadmaps. Whether mastering programming, learning an instrument, or exploring a new language, Eduverse delivers a structured approach to learning through roadmap creation, resource management, and collaboration tools. Built with advanced generative AI, Eduverse simplifies the learning process, empowering users to achieve their goals effectively.

## Problem Statement

Learning a new skill can be overwhelming. Many learners struggle with:

- **Lack of Structure**: Not knowing where to start or how to progress.
- **Resource Overload**: Overwhelming number of resources avaiable online. Difficulty in organizing and managing learning materials.
- **Motivation**: Losing track of progress and feeling demotivated.
- **Collaboration**: Limited ability to share resources or follow others' learning paths.

Eduverse addresses these issues by offering an all-in-one platform that fosters efficient learning through structured roadmaps, intuitive progress tracking, and seamless collaboration and learning path generation powered by generative AI for an optimized user experience.

## Features

### 1. **Create Custom Roadmaps**

- Users can create detailed roadmaps for any skill, breaking it down into modules and topics.
- Example: A roadmap for learning Python could include modules like "Basics," "Data Structures," and "Web Development," with topics like "Variables," "Lists," and "Flask Framework."
- The user can let AI do the roadmap creation if they don't have a fixed path

### 2. **Edit and Update Roadmaps**

- Users can easily modify and update the contents of their roadmaps to reflect their learning progress.
- Example: Add a new topic, reorder modules, or mark a topic as completed.

### 3. **Progress Tracking**

- Track your learning progress and stay motivated.
- Example: Mark topics as "In Progress" or "Completed" and visualize your progress with a progress bar.

### 4. **Resource Management**

- Attach resources (PDFs, videos, links) to specific modules or topics.
- Example: Attach a YouTube tutorial to the "Flask Framework" topic or a PDF eBook to the "Data Structures" module.

### 4. **Automatic Google Drive Integration**

- Add value to other's learning journey by sharing valuable resources.
- Automatic Google Drive upload functionality, which can generate sharable drive links. Which are then accessible to the entire user base.
- Example: Share a resource with a friend by generating a Google Drive link.

### 5. **Social Sharing**

- Share your roadmaps and resources with others or follow roadmaps created by other users.
- Example: Follow a roadmap created by an expert in machine learning or share your own roadmap for learning guitar.

### 6. **Internet Resource Recommendations**

- Eduverse can fetch and recommend relevant links from the internet for the user's convenience by scraping the Bing search engine.
- Example: If a user creates a roadmap for "Machine Learning," Eduverse can recommend top-rated courses, tutorials, and articles from the web.

### 7. **AI-Powered Resource Recommendations**

- Eduverse leverages generative AI to recommend the best study resources from the scraped results from web-based on:
  - **Course Requirements**: The AI analyzes the course content and suggests resources that align with the learning objectives.
  - **User's Current Knowledge Level**: The AI assesses your proficiency and recommends resources accordingly.
    - **Beginner**: If you're new to a topic, Eduverse will suggest beginner-friendly guides, introductory videos, and foundational articles.
    - **Intermediate/Advanced**: For experienced learners, it will recommend advanced tutorials, research papers, and tips & tricks to deepen your expertise.

## How It Benefits Universities and Learners:

- **For Universities**:
- Provide students with structured, up-to-date curricula tailored to their academic needs.
- Ensure seamless access to high-quality resources for each course.
- Streamline the distribution and updating of educational materials.

- **For Learners**:
- Access personalized resource recommendations aligned with your skill level and learning preferences.
- Stay informed with the most recent materials for your selected skill or course.
- Enhance collaboration by sharing and utilizing resources within a peer network effortlessly.

## How It Works

### 1. **Generative AI for Roadmap Creation**

- Eduverse leverages OpenAI's GPT to dynamically generate learning roadmaps based on the desired skill.
- Example: For "Digital Marketing," the AI creates a roadmap featuring modules like "SEO," "Content Marketing," and "Social Media Advertising," each broken down into relevant topics formatted as a course object.

### 2. **Resource Upload and Sharing**

- Users select the "Share Resource" option, granting the app permission to access their Google Drive.
- Upon consent, access and refresh tokens are securely stored on the user's device.
- Resources are uploaded to Google Drive via its API, and a shareable link is generated and stored in the database for easy retrieval.

### 3. **Progress Tracking**

- Topics can be marked as "Not Started," "In Progress," or "Completed."
- A progress bar visually reflects the learnerâ€™s milestones, keeping them motivated and on track.

### 4. **Social Collaboration**

- Browse shared roadmaps, follow those created by others, and access their attached resources.
- Example: A user can follow a roadmap for "Web Development" and access all the resources shared by the creator.

### 5. **Internet Resource Recommendations**

- Eduverse uses web scraping to fetch relevant links from Bing based on the course or skill name.
- Example: For a roadmap on "Data Science," Eduverse can recommend links to freeCodeCamp tutorials, Coursera courses, and Medium articles.
- Recommendations are cached locally to improve performance. Subsequent requests retrieve cached data, ensuring faster response times and efficient use of resources.

### 6. **Curriculum Sharing for Universities**

- Eduverse enables universities and educational institutions to create and share structured learning paths for their curriculum.
- Institutions can attach updated resources, such as lecture notes, research papers, and video tutorials, to each module or topic.
- This feature ensures that students always have access to the latest and most relevant materials and learning paths.
